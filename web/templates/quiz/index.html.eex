      MusicQuizz is a simple game to test your knowledge of all things music.
      Questions are generated randomly from Spotify's vast library
      of artists, albums, and genres. Because of this, questions can range from
      being exceptionally easy to exceptionally difficult. You can check out
      quizzes related to a genre of music, or simply look at all quizzes.
      Put your knowledge to the test!
